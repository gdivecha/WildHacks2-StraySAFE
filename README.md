<strong><big><u>Description:</u>üìù</big></strong><br/>
It takes a long time for a team to coordinate effectively when faced with a limit interval of time. However, our team was able to form a compressive Idea that can be the resolution to our previously inquired dilemma of pets ‚Äúgoing missing‚Äù. We came up with developing a website(StraySAFE) that may be used by all pet owners to be able to report missing pets in an easy and quick manner. the website will allow for registration for not only those who wish to report, but for those to respond to search requests. We implemented a situation for reporting animals that allows for any individual utilizing StraySAFE to find pets that went missing near their location or the location of the post. Since there is no stable system available, we wish to be the first to improve and help rescue pets from everywhere. A system with a focus that eases the worries of owners and brings a more controlled environment for pets to live in.

<strong><big>Inspiration:üí°</big></strong><br/>
When it came to the development of StraySAFE, our goal was to aspire to create a unique system that enables environmental sustainability for pet owners, and the safe keeping of their household pets. We were shocked to find find limit resources available for those who have to experience the stress of losing a pet or being endangered by an animal. Our team brought our heads together and developed a system that is user-friendly and can be emplaced for all pet owners that may be across the globe. 

<strong><big>What it does:ü§î</big></strong><br/>
It is a Pet monitoring system, that allows you to inlist missing pets, and allows you to keep track of your pet when someone reports findng it in the community. Along with animal control, this website raises awareness in the pet community towards missing pets. According to our statistics done via MatLab in the diagram below, we found the need for the existence of this website as the statistics show the urgency of pets going missing. <br/>

<strong><big>How we built it:ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</big></strong><br/>
Front end: used HTML, CSS, Javascript to create the layout of the website

Back end: we used localstorage as a way to store account and pet data in the web and use that data to access the website


<strong><big> Challenges We ran into:‚öîÔ∏è</big></strong><br/>‚öî
We did our best effort attempted to work efficiently and effectively. But this did leave for some trecherous obstacles for us to overcome. One of the largest of issues was stylizing the website with CSS, this took a decent amount of time and gave us some tecnical issues as well, due to the goal of ours to create a clean and user-friendly UI. The other obstacle occured in the backend part of the process, we experienced some issues.

<strong><big>Accomplishments that we're proud of:üìö</big></strong><br/>

<strong><big>What we learned:‚úçÔ∏è</big></strong><br/>
The overall project took a extensive amount of time and is quiete ambitious that could cause for future developments. As such were able to aquire a handful of skills,both tecnically and collaboratively. This includes being able to manage time between programming and discussing conceptual ideas and design choices. We also aquired a method in effectively debugging code blocks, this along side strengthing our understanding of frontend and back end languages. We were able to find fixes and work arounds through trial an error and peer analysis. By far one of the biggest learning acheivments comes behind or organizational skills to tackle and obstacle or idea in suffiecent matter, considering all possible ideas and including everyones share of input. Our philopshy is that of simple nature, in order to achieve a goal all parties must be engaged and respected for the aspiration  of succesful development. To become stronger developers means to become better assets to a team workspace.<br/>

<strong><big>What's next for StraySAFE:‚è≠Ô∏è</big></strong><br/>
The creation of StraySAFE holds as a project that can witness multiple changes/improvments given the correct amount of skills and time. We wish the further our developing skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc. The goal off entering this hackathon was to be able to come up with a unique concept and be able to complete our vison in the time given to us, plus the opportunity to express our skills in competiton to other teams. After the event we will continue to integrate new ideas and concepts, such as "Animal Tracker" which will allow the user to be able to see a marker on a map with the general radius of the last known siting of the missing animal. This alongside developing an actual usuable website for all pet owners and people alike to be able to use, who knows how big a small idea can become.

<strong><big>Where to find the project:‚úàÔ∏è</big></strong><br/>
The project can be located on our github as well as Devpost. 

<strong><big>Targeted Audience:üë•</big></strong><br/>
The audience is an expansive ideology, at first StraySAFE caters towards lawful pet owners, or people who are in some way or shape involved with domestic animals. although this may seem to be the case, we believe this will in fact allow for known pet owners to be contributing members of society, as well as bring confidents for new and aspiring pet owners. Remember a protective and safe pet environment will allow for future pet owners to be more relaxed when it comes to taking care of their animal.

<strong><big>Functionality Requirements:‚úÖ</big></strong><br/>
In order for this to be a functional website,  it requires of mix of developing using frontend/backend programming languages. For the implementation of StraySAFE we used HTML CSS, Twilio, and JavaScript.
